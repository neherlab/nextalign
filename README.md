<h2 id="about" align="center">
👋 About
</h2>

Nextalign is the viral genome sequence alignment algorithm used in [Nextclade](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade),
ported to C++ and made to a standalone command-line tool.

Nextalign performs pairwise alignment of provided sequences against a given reference sequence using a banded local alignment with affine gap-cost. Band width and rough relative positions are determined through seed matching.

Currently, nextalign's primary focus is on SARS-CoV-2 genome, but it can be used on any virus with a sufficiently similar reference sequence (less than a 5% divergence).
Nextalign will strip insertions relative to the reference and output them in a separate CSV file.

<h3 id="quick-start" align="center">
✨ Quick start
</h3>

1. Install and configure required dependencies

   - C++17-compliant C++ compiler

     > ⚠️ Only GCC >= 9 and Clang >= 10 are officially supported (but you can try older versions too and tell us how it goes).

   - [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.10

   - [conan](https://conan.io/) package manager

     > 💡 For Ubuntu Linux there is an installation script included in `./tools/install-conan`

   - [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)

     > ⚠️ A version that supports C++17 is required

   - (optional, but recommended) [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

     > ⚠️ nodemon requires Node.js and npm. You can install it globally with:
     >
     > ```bash
     > npm install --global nodemon
     > ```

2. Clone and run

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign
   cd nextalign
   make dev

   ```

   > ⚠️ Note the `--recursive` flag for `git` command - this repository contains git submodules

   This will:

   - install or update conan packages
   - run cmake and generate makefiles
   - build the project and tests
   - run static analysis on source files
   - run tests
   - run CLI with parameters defined in `DEV_CLI_OPTIONS` environment variable
   - watch source files and rebuild on changes

   > 💡 If you don't want to install Node.js and nodemon, or don't want the automatic rebuild feature, you can use `make dev-nowatch` instead of `make dev`.

The CLI binary is produced in `.build/Debug/packages/nextalign_cli/nextalign_cli`. The tests binary is
in `.build/Release/packages/nextalign/tests/nextalign_tests`. You can run them directly too, if you'd like.

You can change the default arguments of the CLI invocation make by the `make dev` target by creating a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and modifying the `DEV_CLI_OPTIONS` variable.

> 💡 The default input files are located in [`data/example`](https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign/tree/master/data/example)

> 💡 By default, the output files are produced in `tmp/` directory in the root of the project.

> ⚠️ Do not measure performance of executables produced with `make dev` and do not use them for real workloads. Development builds, with disabled optimizations and with enabled debugging tools and instrumentation, are meant for developer's productivity, not runtime performance, and can be orders of magnitudes slower than the optimized build. Instead, for any performance assessments, use [benchmarks](#microbenchmarks), [profiling](#runtime-performance-assessment) or [production build](#production-build). In real workloads always use the [production build](#production-build).

---

<h3 id="production-build" align="center">
⏩ Production build
</h3>

Having the requirements from the ["Quick start" section](#quick-start) installed, run

```bash
make prod
```

This will produce the optimized executable in `.build/Release/packages/nextalign_cli/nextalign_cli`, which you can run
directly. This is what we (will) redistribute to the end users.

#### 🪑 Microbenchmarks

A set of benchmarks is located
in [`packages/nextalign/benchmarks`](https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign/tree/master/packages/nextalign/benchmarks).
We are using [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) framework. Read the
important [Runtime and Reporting Considerations](https://github.com/google/benchmark#runtime-and-reporting-considerations)
.

> ⚠️ For the most accurate results, you should [disable CPU frequence scaling](https://github.com/google/benchmark#disabling-cpu-frequency-scaling) for the time of your benchmarking session. (More info: [[kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html)]
> , [[arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling)]
> , [[debian](https://wiki.debian.org/CpuFrequencyScaling)])

> 💡 As a simple solution, on most modern hardware and Linux distros, before running benchmarks you could temporarily switch to `performance` governor, with
>
> ```bash
> sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
> ```
>
> and then back to `powersave` governor with
>
> ```bash
> sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor powersave
> ```

Run benchmarks with

```bash
make benchmarks
```

This will install dependencies, build the library and benchmarks in "Release" mode and will run the benchmarks.
Benchmarks will rerun on code changes.

Or run the `scripts/benchmarks.sh` directly (no hot reloading).

You can also run the executable directly, it is localed
in `.build/Benchmarks-Release/packages/nextalign/benchmarks/nextalign_benchmarks`

> 💡 For better debugging experience, you can also build in "Debug" mode and run under GDB with:
>
> ```bash
> CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug USE_GDB=1 make benchmarks
> ```

You can pass parameters to the benchmark executable with either of:

```bash
BENCHMARK_OPTIONS='--help' make benchmarks
scripts/benchmarks.sh --help
```

For example, you can filter the benchmarks by name: to run only the benchmarks containing the word "Average":

```bash
BENCHMARK_OPTIONS='--benchmark_filter=.*Average' make benchmarks
```

The results are also saved to the file `nextalign_benchmarks.json`. You can compare multiple results using
the [compare.py](https://github.com/google/benchmark/tree/master/tools) tool in the Google Benchmark's repository. For
more information refer to [Benchmark Tools](https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/master/docs/tools.md)
documentation.

#### 🛀 Sanitizers

Sanitizers are the binary instrumentation tools, which help to find various runtime issues related to memory management,
threading and programming mistakes which lead to [undefined behavior](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/behavior)
.

The project is set up to build with sanitizers, if one of the following `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`s is set:

| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | Effect                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASAN             | [Address](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) + [Leak](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html) sanitizers |
| MSAN             | [Memory sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)                                                             |
| TSAN             | [Thread sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html)                                                             |
| UBSAN            | [Undefined behavior sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)                                      |

> 💡 For example, if the program is crashing with a segfault, you could to try to run address sanitizer on it:
>
> ```
> CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASAN make dev
> ```

> 💡 Both GCC and Clang support these sanitizers to various degrees, but there might be kinks here and there. So you might need to try with both compilers (see: [Use non-default compiler](#use-non-default-compiler)).

#### Valgrind

<h3 id="use-non-default-compiler" align="center">
⚙️ Use non-default compiler
</h3>

#### Building with Clang

You can tell build scripts to forcefully use Clang instead of the default compiler (e.g. GCC on Linux) by setting the
environment variable `USE_CLANG=1`. For example:

```
USE_CLANG=1 make dev
USE_CLANG=1 make prod
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASAN USE_CLANG=1 make dev

```

In this case, binaries will be produced in directories postfixed with `-Clang`, e.g. `.build/Debug-Clang`.

> 💡 On Ubuntu you can build LLVM project (including Clang) with a script provided in `scripts/deps/build_llvm.sh`. It depends on binutils which should be built with `scripts/deps/build_binutils.sh` prior to that. There is also a script to build GCC: `scripts/deps/build_gcc.sh`. Refer to comments inside these scripts for the list of dependencies required. As a result of these scripts, the ready-to-use compilers will be in `3rdparty/gcc` and `3rdparty/llvm`,

> 💡 The projects' build system is setup to automatically pickup the `gcc` and `g++` executables from `3rdparty/gcc/bin/`, and `clang` and `clang++` executables from `3rdparty/llvm/bin/` if any of those exist.

#### 🚅 Link-time optimization (LTO)

Runtime performance is important for this project and for production builds we use a gold-plugin-enabled linker
executable.

> 💡 On Ubuntu you can build it along with other binutils using the provided script in `scripts/deps/build_binutils.sh`. The results of the build will be in `3rdparty/binutils`.

> 💡 The projects' build system is setup to automatically pickup the `ld` linker from `3rdparty/binutils/bin/` if it exists.

😮 Troubleshooting
</h3>

#### 1. I have a newer version of a compiler, but conan and cmake keep using the old one

The `./tools/install-conan` script makes conan to remember compiler that was in the `PATH` when the script has been
executed.

As a workaround you may try to add the new compiler to the `PATH` and delete and regenerate conan profile:

- Remove the old profile by deleting `~/.conan` directory
- run `./tools/install-conan`
- rebuild the project and and watch for `<VERSION>`:

  ```
  compiler=gcc
  ...
  compiler.version=<VERSION>
  ```

in console output of the "Install dependencies" build step, and/or set `CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=1` variable and check the
compiler path used during "Build" step.

TODO: use conan profile local to the project, to simplify usage of different compilers.

#### 2. I have other strange things happening during build

Try to remove the build directory (`.build`) and rebuild.
