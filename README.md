<h2 id="about" align="center">
üëã About
</h2>

Nextalign is the viral genome sequence alignment algorithm used in [Nextclade](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade),
ported to C++ and made to a standalone command-line tool.

Nextalign performs pairwise alignment of provided sequences against a given reference sequence using a banded local alignment with affine gap-cost. Band width and rough relative positions are determined through seed matching.

Currently Nextalign primarily focuses on SARS-CoV-2 genome, but it can be used on any virus, given a sufficiently similar reference sequence (less than a 5% divergence). Nextalign will strip insertions relative to the reference and output them in a separate CSV file.

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Inputs

Nextalign accepts the following inputs:

| Required | Meaning            | Flag                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| yes      | Sequences          | `--sequences=<path>`        | Path to a file containing sequences to align ("query" sequences). Every sequence in this file will be pairwise-aligned with the reference sequence. Accepted formats: fasta. Example: [`--sequences=data/example/sequences.fasta`](data/example/sequences.fasta)        |
| yes      | Reference sequence | `--reference=<path>`        | Path to a file containing reference sequence to align against. Accepted formats: fasta (1 sequence only), plain text.

Example: [`--genemap=data/example/genemap.gff`](data/example/genemap.gff) |
| no       | Genes              | `--genes=<gene1,gene2,...>` | A comma-separated list of genes to use for alignment refinement. All listed genes should be present in the gene map. Affects performance and accuracy. If flag is not provided or empty, all genes present in gene map are used. Example: `--genes=E,ORF1a`             |

#### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Outputs

Nextalign produces the following outputs:

| Required | Meaning              | Flag                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no       | Output directory     | `--output-dir=<path>`        | Nextalign will write all output files to this directory. By default, will output files to the current directory.                                                                |

</h2>

<h3 id="quick-start" align="center">
‚ú® Quick start
</h3>

1.  Install and configure the dependencies

    - Required:

      - C++17-compliant C++ compiler

        > ‚ö†Ô∏è Only GCC >= 9 and Clang >= 10 are officially supported (but you can try older versions too and tell us how it goes).

      - [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.10

      - [conan](https://conan.io/) package manager

        > üí° For Ubuntu Linux there is an installation script included in `./tools/install-conan`

      - [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) for static analysis

        > ‚ö†Ô∏è A version that supports C++17 is required

    - Recommended:

      - [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) for faster rebuilds

        > üí° On Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives it can be installed with
        >
        > ```
        > sudo apt-get install ccache
        > ```

      - [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for watch & rebuild feature for better developer experience

        > ‚ö†Ô∏è nodemon requires Node.js and npm. You can install it globally with:
        >
        > ```bash
        > npm install --global nodemon
        > ```

        > üí° If you don't want to install Node.js and nodemon, or don't want the automatic watch & rebuild feature, you can use `make dev-nowatch` instead of `make dev` during development.

      - [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) for static analysis. It is recommended to use an text editor or an IDE with clang-tidy support

2.  Clone, run and develop

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign
    cd nextalign
    make dev
    ```

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note the `--recursive` flag for `git` command - this repository contains git submodules

    This will:

    - install or update conan packages
    - run cmake and generate makefiles
    - build the project and tests
    - run static analysis on source files
    - run tests
    - run CLI with parameters defined in `DEV_CLI_OPTIONS` environment variable
    - watch source files and rebuild on changes

    > üí° If you don't want to install Node.js and nodemon, or don't want the automatic watch & rebuild feature, you can use `make dev-nowatch` instead of `make dev` during development.

    üéâ You are ready! Start coding! In particular, take a look at these files and directories:

    ```
    packages/nextalign_cli/src/
    packages/nextalign_cli/src/cli.cpp # Entry pint of the CLI executable

    packages/nextalign/src/
    packages/nextalign/src/nextalign.cpp # Entry point of the library is the `nextalign()` function in this file
    ```

    The CLI binary is produced in `.build/Debug/packages/nextalign_cli/nextalign_cli`
    The tests binary is in `.build/Debug/packages/nextalign/tests/nextalign_tests`.
    You can run them directly too, if you'd like.

    You can change the default arguments of the CLI invocation make by the `make dev` target by creating a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    and modifying the `DEV_CLI_OPTIONS` variable.

    > üí° The default input files are located in [`data/example`](https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign/tree/master/data/example)

    > üí° By default, the output files are produced in `tmp/` directory in the root of the project.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not measure performance of executables produced with `make dev` and do not use them for real workloads. Development builds, with disabled optimizations and with enabled debugging tools and instrumentation, are meant for developer's productivity, not runtime performance, and can be orders of magnitudes slower than the optimized build. Instead, for any performance assessments, use [benchmarks](#microbenchmarks), [profiling](#runtime-performance-assessment) or [production build](#production-build). In real workloads always use the [production build](#production-build).

---

<h3 id="production-build" align="center">
‚è© Production build
</h3>

Having the requirements from the ["Quick start" section](#quick-start) installed, run

```bash
make prod
```

This will produce the optimized executable in `.build/Release/packages/nextalign_cli/nextalign_cli`, which you can run directly. This is what we (will) redistribute to the end users.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Production build (and all builds with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` enforce [standalone static executable](#standalone-static-build)) configuration.

#### ü™ë Microbenchmarks

A set of benchmarks is located
in [`packages/nextalign/benchmarks`](https://github.com/neherlab/nextalign/tree/master/packages/nextalign/benchmarks).
We are using [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) framework. Read the
important [Runtime and Reporting Considerations](https://github.com/google/benchmark#runtime-and-reporting-considerations)
.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For the most accurate results, you should [disable CPU frequence scaling](https://github.com/google/benchmark#disabling-cpu-frequency-scaling) for the time of your benchmarking session. (More info: [[kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html)]
> , [[arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling)]
> , [[debian](https://wiki.debian.org/CpuFrequencyScaling)])

> üí° As a simple solution, on most modern hardware and Linux distros, before running benchmarks you could temporarily switch to `performance` governor, with
>
> ```bash
> sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
> ```
>
> and then back to `powersave` governor with
>
> ```bash
> sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor powersave
> ```

Run benchmarks with

```bash
make benchmarks
```

This will install dependencies, build the library and benchmarks in "Release" mode and will run the benchmarks.
Benchmarks will rerun on code changes.

Or run the `scripts/benchmarks.sh` directly (no hot reloading).

You can also run the executable directly, it is localed
in `.build/Benchmarks-Release/packages/nextalign/benchmarks/nextalign_benchmarks`

> üí° For better debugging experience, you can also build in "Debug" mode and run under GDB with:
>
> ```bash
> CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug USE_GDB=1 make benchmarks
> ```

You can pass parameters to the benchmark executable with either of:

```bash
BENCHMARK_OPTIONS='--help' make benchmarks
scripts/benchmarks.sh --help
```

For example, you can filter the benchmarks by name: to run only the benchmarks containing the word "Average":

```bash
BENCHMARK_OPTIONS='--benchmark_filter=.*Average' make benchmarks
```

The results are also saved to the file `nextalign_benchmarks.json`. You can compare multiple results using
the [compare.py](https://github.com/google/benchmark/tree/master/tools) tool in the Google Benchmark's repository. For
more information refer to [Benchmark Tools](https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/master/docs/tools.md)
documentation.

<h3 id="runtime-analysis" align="center">
üî• Runtime analysis
</h3>

We use the following tools to perform runtime analysis of the builds. All of these tools should run cleanly, with no crashes, and with empty reports.

#### üõÄ Sanitizers

Sanitizers are the binary instrumentation tools, which help to find various runtime issues related to memory management,
threading and programming mistakes which lead to [undefined behavior](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/behavior)
.

The project is set up to build with sanitizers, if one of the following `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`s is set:

| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | Effect                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASAN             | [Address](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) + [Leak](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html) sanitizers |
| MSAN             | [Memory sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)                                                             |
| TSAN             | [Thread sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html)                                                             |
| UBSAN            | [Undefined behavior sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)                                      |

> üí° For example, if the program is crashing with a segfault, you could to try to run address sanitizer on it:
>
> ```
> CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASAN make dev
> ```

> üí° Both GCC and Clang support these sanitizers to various degrees, but there might be kinks here and there. So you might need to try with both compilers (see: [Use non-default compiler](#use-non-default-compiler)).

#### Valgrind

TODO: under construction

<h3 id="use-non-default-compiler" align="center">
‚öôÔ∏è Use non-default compiler
</h3>

#### Building with Clang

You can tell build scripts to forcefully use Clang instead of the default compiler (e.g. GCC on Linux) by setting the
environment variable `USE_CLANG=1`. For example:

```
USE_CLANG=1 make dev
USE_CLANG=1 make prod
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ASAN USE_CLANG=1 make dev

```

In this case, binaries will be produced in directories postfixed with `-Clang`, e.g. `.build/Debug-Clang`.

> üí° On Ubuntu you can build LLVM project (including Clang) with a script provided in `scripts/deps/build_llvm.sh`. It depends on binutils which should be built with `scripts/deps/build_binutils.sh` prior to that. There is also a script to build GCC: `scripts/deps/build_gcc.sh`. Refer to comments inside these scripts for the list of dependencies required. As a result of these scripts, the ready-to-use compilers will be in `3rdparty/gcc` and `3rdparty/llvm`,

> üí° The projects' build system is setup to automatically pickup the `gcc` and `g++` executables from `3rdparty/gcc/bin/`, and `clang` and `clang++` executables from `3rdparty/llvm/bin/` if any of those exist.

---

<h3 id="distribution" align="center">
üöÄ Distribution
</h3>

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Standalone static build

To simplify distribution to end users, we produce standalone, statically linked binaries, as well as a minimalistic docker image, containing only single executable.

By default static build is enable for all builds that have `CMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release` (that is, production build and benchmarks). It can be selectively enabled or disabled during build time, using environment variable `NEXTALIGN_STATIC_BUILD="(0|1)"`:

```bash
NEXTALIGN_STATIC_BUILD=1 make dev # produces statically-linked dev build
NEXTALIGN_STATIC_BUILD=0 make prod # produces dynamically-liked prod build

```

See PR #7 for caveats and other considerations.

#### üöÖ Link-time optimization (LTO)

Runtime performance is important for this project and for production builds we use a gold-plugin-enabled linker
executable.

> üí° On Ubuntu you can build it along with other binutils using the provided script in `scripts/deps/build_binutils.sh`. The results of the build will be in `3rdparty/binutils`.

> üí° The projects' build system is setup to automatically pickup the `ld` linker from `3rdparty/binutils/bin/` if it exists.

<h3 id="troubleshooting" align="center">
üòÆ Troubleshooting
</h3>

#### 1. I have a newer version of a compiler, but conan and cmake keep using the old one

The `./tools/install-conan` script makes conan to remember compiler that was in the `PATH` when the script has been
executed.

As a workaround you may try to add the new compiler to the `PATH` and delete and regenerate conan profile:

- Remove the old profile by deleting `~/.conan` directory
- run `./tools/install-conan`
- rebuild the project and and watch for `<VERSION>`:

  ```
  compiler=gcc
  ...
  compiler.version=<VERSION>
  ```

in console output of the "Install dependencies" build step, and/or set `CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=1` variable and check the
compiler path used during "Build" step.

TODO: use conan profile local to the project, to simplify usage of different compilers.

#### 2. I have other strange things happening during build

Try to remove the build directory (`.build`) and rebuild.
